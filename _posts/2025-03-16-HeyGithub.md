# Jesus it's been a while...

Hello to absolutely nobody in particular (because nobody reads these). If you don't remember me, it's Fender!

I recently restarted on my roblox studio high and thought I'd make a blog post after like, 40 years.

> So, what have you been doing?

I quit Luau to do JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (web developement). I now know all of these pretty well, and randomly one day, [Phoenix (click here if you forget who he is)](https://goobismoobis.github.io/GoobisBlog/2024/08/25/FirstDevblog.html#:~:text=on%20with%20my-,IRL%20freind%20Phoenix,-%2C%20an%20online%20friend) asked me if I wanted to code a roblox game.

I already had one project I was working on before I quit studio, but had wuit in the middle of making it's foundation and it was relatively basic.

It is no longer basic.
