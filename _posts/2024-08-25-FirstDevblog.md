## Yeah... I did not go to sleep like I said i would last blog post
Instead, I stayed up for a while and ended up getting into an argument with one of the devs ([White Turtle](https://www.roblox.com/users/1313328468/profile)) working on my current game I'm making on Roblox.
#### I realize I haven't talked about my current game yet... here's a bit about it.
It's called Modern RTS, or at least it is right now. It's based on my current favorite game on Roblox, [Normal Real-time strategy game.](https://www.roblox.com/games/8590762007/normal-real-time-strategy-game-RTS-BETA) It's a strategy game i'm working on with my IRL freind [Phoenix](https://www.roblox.com/users/4892317634/profile), an online friend [whiteturtle0923](https://www.roblox.com/users/1313328468/profile), with another guy, [Kuro](https://www.roblox.com/users/1218057944/profile) as our main playtester. The game is hosted on our dev group, [Yimello Studios](https://www.roblox.com/groups/33377712/Yimello-studios#!/about).
### Anyways, here are some features we've added so far:
- Custom command terminal, which is better than roblox's built-in one
   - HAS EXPLOIT DETECTION TOO!
- Admin feature where admins can teleport to servers if they have something called their JobId
- A placement system for buildings
#### features coming soon:
- Ban system
- Announcement system
- Kick system
- bigger maps

and what me and WhiteTurtle got into an argument about, the MENU/LOBBY
----
So whats the problem?
**PHYSICAL LOBBY VS MENU**

I am strongly for a hybrid, that is a physical lobby WITH menu elements.

Whiteturtle wants just a menu.

My logic is that a physical lobby doesn't crowd the screen with Gui, and is easier to understand. It also works well for NRTSG (abbreviation of Normal Real-time Strategy Game) so I see no reason it ahouldn't work for our game. Adding menu elements makes sure it maintains a balance and isn't _all_ physical, because I agree with WhiteTurtle, _just_ physical is bad.

I understand WhiteTurtles logic: a menu is cleaner, takes less time, and might make finding a lobby easier. I just personally think the effort for a physical lobby is worth it.

I stand by my opinion, but maybe WhiteTurtle will convince me?

Who knows, maybe he'll eventually start his own blog if I pressure him enough and he'll make some really good points that change my mind.

Anyway, it's officially past 1:00 AM, so imma go to bed. Maybe tommorow when my frontal lobe is functioning better i'll realize I'm dumb snd change my mind.

bye! :)
