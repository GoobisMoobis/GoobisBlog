I had a three-day weekend this weekend, and my family (mainly me, my mom, and my brother) went to an amusement park on monday! However, the night before me and my mom did a lot of house cleaning and stuff, and went golfing, and the night before me and my mom went to a drive-in movie. So unless I wanted to stay up until like 1:00AM at night, I couldn't really work much on my roblox game or make a blog post. Hopefully later this week (probably not after this one today, or tommorow or the day after) i'll be able to be more active on here and work more on the game.

However, here is some of the stuff I managed to do in my limited amount of time.

* polish some admin systems, like the terminal and the admin gui
* Make the skeleton of the Server Ban system
* Talk to my friends about how developement was going
* Made a Tampermonkey script for myself to make my blog look better when I view it (I almost made this one myself; just needed some help to change the favicon in chrome, and to move around a few HTML elements)

That's it for now. Hopefully I'll be able to make more progress on the game this week :)
