If you look at the blog posts I've made thus far, you probably saw this one's date and thought, "Why was there such a long break?" tbh I just forgot about this lol.

I came back just yesterday on my GitHub account to make another [blog for my faction I'm working on for NRTS!](https://goobismoobis.github.io/RationalityFactionAnnouncements/)

> "Wait... NRTS? Faction? What happened to the development of your own RTS game?"

Development of that is currently paused, but expected to start back up within the next month :)

When development paused, I got back into NRTS. Eventually, I found this guy named B1ack when I was playing with Mister1er (a good NRTS player I was friends with). He kept talking about a Discord server (going around the Roblox chat filter, of course), so I asked about it, and I got invited!

It turns out a bunch of other pro players, including LeafyPotatoStyle, Kuro (the main tester guy I talked about [here](https://goobismoobis.github.io/GoobisBlog/2024/08/25/FirstDevblog.html), and Mister1er, were all in it. I started getting better and getting back into NRTS, and now I play ranked 1v1s semi-regularly, though I'm not that good.

And, it's been probably a month or 2 now since I joined, and Leafy is starting to add a new thing called "factions." I'm technically not meant to know this but it isn't like anyone from the discord will see this, so yeah lol.

I've started my own faction (though factions aren't public yet so technically it hasn't been formally started yet) to get a head start when factions become public.

Here is a small list of things developed in Modern RTS before development paused:
* New models
* A new modeling system to make it easier to make models
* Somehow a bunch of stuff broke (probably because of the new models lol)

Anyways, that's it for now. Hopefully I'll be able to remember to post more regularly here :)
