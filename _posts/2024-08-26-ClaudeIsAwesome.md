It's not like anyone actually reads these blog posts, but if you are one of my friends, family, or a random person who somehow found my blog and clicked on this specific post, TRY CLAUDE.

I woke up this morning and saw a youtube video pop up on my recommended: [Claude 3.5 Deep Dive: This new AI destroys GPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7JCor1DGJw)

I decided to watch it, and it seemed way too good to be true, but I had school so I couldn't test it. As soon as I got home however, I created an account on [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/new) (and also one on [poe.com](https://poe.com/) so I could get some more chatting out of Claude) and decided to have it write a Tampermonkey script.

> Fact: I don't just code on roblox! Remember this for things I post later which might mention this

What did I want my tampermonkey script to do?
