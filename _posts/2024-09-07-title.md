Oh. My. **GOD** today was hard.

It was fun, I learned a lot. But yeah. A lot has been added.
* ```TODO``` script: a disabled script in ServerStorage for me, WhiteTurtle, and Nohack (haven't talked about him in a bit) to track our progress if we aren't on a call
* Money system
* Custom Leaderboard
* And (funnily enough) what took the longest (4+ hours) the "Z" button system.

What is that you ask? well in NRTSG, if you click Z, this happens:

As you can see, it highlights units. But the square is weird, so instead, using the actual [highlight object](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Highlight) and TweenService, we made this effect.
(sorry for bad video quality and no embed, i'll try to find a service like postimages for videos videos)

And Nohack, who hasn't been working on the game much, has recently done quite a bit!

There is a limit to how many highlights can be displayed on the screen at one time so we'll have to find a workaround for that.

Also, when we add units there will be a seperate button to highlight buildings and units, because NRTSG doesn't allow building highlights.

It's almost midnight and I'm tired so i'l write a more detailed post tommorow about everything I couldn't fit in here.

Bye :)
