# Welcome back to my blog!

I'll try to start posting more regular updates on here. No promises!

So, what is this blog about?

If you haven't heard me talk bout the terminal, please do what I said at the beggining of this post and read about URTG and MRTS

## Without further ado, here is how I came up with the terminal, how I made it, etc

When I originally started MRT I had no intention of making a terminal. Or even any sort of admin gui. So, what sparked my inspiration?

Well, it actually didn't start with MRTS, it started with a side project I was working on called noob factory tycoon. I was trying to run something from roblox's default command line, but it wasn't working. I kept getting an error.

Then I realized 2 important things about roblox's basic command line interface

1. It's really bad. There's no syntax highlighting, you can only write code on 1 line, it's just horrific
2. I'm really bad at using it

So, I did what every roblox dev has done at least 4 billion times: I looked up my problem on google.
